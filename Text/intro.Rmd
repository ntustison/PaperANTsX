# Introduction

ANTs is a state-of-the-art, open-source software toolkit for image registration,
segmentation, and other medical image analysis functionality. Historically, ANTs
is rooted in advanced image registration techniques which have been at the
forefront of the field characterized by seminal contributions that date back to
the original elastic matching method of Bajcsy and co-investigators
[@Bajcsy:1982aa;@Bajcsy:1989aa;@Gee:2003aa]. Our most recent work, embodied in
the ANTs cross-platform toolkit for multiple modality image processing,
continues to set the standard in the field for pulmonary [@Murphy:2011aa], brain
[@Klein:2009aa], and cardiac imaging [@Tustison:2015ab]. The ANTs registration
component not only encodes advanced developments in image registration research,
notably the Symmetric Normalization (SyN) algorithm for deformable diffeomorphic
mappings [@Avants:2008aa], but also packages these normalization tools within a
full-featured platform that includes an extensive library of similarity
measures, transformation types, and regularizers which are built upon the robust
Insight Toolkit and vetted by users and developers from all over the world
[@Avants:2014aa]. Since its inception, though, ANTs has expanded significantly
beyond its image registration origins.  We have contributed to other core
subfields with state-of-the-art algorithms and implementations, including
template building [@Avants:2010aa], segmentation [@Avants:2011aa], image
preprocessing (e.g., bias correction [@Tustison2009e] and denoising
[@Manjon:2010aa]), joint label fusion [@Wang:2013aa;@Wang:2013ab], and brain
cortical thickness estimation [@Das:2009aa;@Tustison:2014ab]. By providing
essential medical image analysis functionality in an accessible and flexible
software package, ANTs is able to meet the real-world needs of thousands of
users in many areas of health-related research
