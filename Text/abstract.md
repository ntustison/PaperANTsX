# Abstract {-}

The Advanced Normalizations Tools ecosystem, known as ANTsX, consists of
multiple open-source software libraries which house top-performing algorithms
used worldwide by scientific and research communities for processing and
analyzing biological and medical imaging data. The base software library, ANTs,
is built upon, and contributes to, the NIH-sponsored Insight Toolkit.  Founded
in 2008 with the highly regarded Symmetric Normalization image registration
framework, the ANTs library has since grown to include additional functionality.
Recent enhancements include statistical, visualization, and deep learning
capabilities through interfacing with both the R statistical project (ANTsR) and
Python (ANTsPy). Additionally, the corresponding deep learning extensions
ANTsRNet and ANTsPyNet (built on the popular TensorFlow/Keras libraries) contain
several popular network architectures and trained models for specific
applications.  One such comprehensive application is a deep learning analog for
generating cortical thickness data from structural T1-weighted brain MRI.  Not
only does this significantly improve computational efficiency and
comparable-to-superior accuracy over the existing ANTs pipeline but it also
illustrates the importance of the comprehensive ANTsX approach as a framework
for medical image analysis.
