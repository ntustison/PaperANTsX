# Abstract {-}

The ANTs ecosystem consists of multiple software libraries spanning several
programming languages which houses top-performing algorithms used worldwide by
scientific and research communities in their investigations involving medical
imaging data. The base software library, ANTs, is built upon the well-known
NIH-funded Insight Toolkit (ITK) which has historically been a significant
resource of open-source algorithmic and software innovation. Given its
open-source developmental history, it has contributed to both academic and
industrial partners in meeting modern quantitative imaging needs with particular
focus on issues in biomedical imaging. Applications and published research
literature sample the study of organisms from small animals to humans as well as
target organ systems such as respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous. Since the
inception of the ANTs library in 2008, the image registration component alone
has been cited close to 5000 times across journals spanning the gamut of
biomedical and imaging research. Recent software engineering efforts have
included the development of additional statistical, visualization, and deep
learning capabilities through ANTs-based interfacing with other heavily utilized
software packages. This includes ANTsR (the R statistical project), ANTsPy
(Python), and ANTsPyNet/ANTsRNet---all of which are organized under the ANTsX
software ecosystem and available on the GitHub software hosting system.
