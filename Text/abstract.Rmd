# Abstract {-}

The Advanced Normalizations Tools ecosystem, known as ANTsX, consists of
multiple open-source software libraries which house top-performing algorithms
used worldwide by scientific and research communities for processing and
analyzing biological and medical imaging data. The base software library, ANTs,
is built upon, and contributes to, the NIH-sponsored Insight Toolkit.  Founded
in 2008 with the highly regarded Symmetric Normalization image registration
framework, the ANTs library has since grown to include additional
state-of-the-art image analysis functionality.  Recent enhancements include
statistical, visualization, and deep learning capabilities through interfacing
with both the R statistical project (ANTsR) and Python (ANTsPy). Additionally,
the corresponding deep learning extensions ANTsRNet and ANTsPyNet (built
on the popular TensorFlow/Keras libraries) contain several popular network
architectures and trained models for specific applications.  One such comprehensive
application is a deep learning analog for generating cortical thickness data
from structural T1-weighted brain MRI.  We demonstrate that this pipeline
not only significantly improves computational efficiency over the current
ANTs approach but also provides comparable to superior performance on multiple
publicly available data sets.
